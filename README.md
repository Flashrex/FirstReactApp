# My first React App

This is my first React App created following the "[Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#before-we-start-the-tutorial)" Tutorial on reactjs.org

I also implemented these extra challenges:
  - Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
  - Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
  - ~~Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.~~
  - ~~Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.~~
  - When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
  - When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

And i styled the app for your viewing pleasure.
