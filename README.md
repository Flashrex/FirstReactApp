# My first React App

This is my first React App created following the "[Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#before-we-start-the-tutorial)" Tutorial on reactjs.org

I also implemented these extra challenges:
  - Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
  - ~~Bold~~ Highlight the currently selected item in the move list.
  - When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
  - When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

And i styled the app for your viewing pleasure.

# Running this app

To start this app simply download this repo and run `npm start` in the project directory via console.
